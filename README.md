                **Software Description**
************************************************************************
This software, developed by Dr. Musaddiq Al Ali, is designed
to generate microstructures for 3D printing in STL file format. 
To use the software, load your 3D design as a voxelized data 
matrix saved in a .mat file. The software will process the input 
and generate the corresponding microstructure by applying the 
isosurface technique, converting the data into a printable STL format.
